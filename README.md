# local-social-ai-manager

A local-first AI social media manager for small businesses, local service businesses, and owner-operators.

This project has a local-first MVP foundation with a static web shell, SQLite
services, and a localhost bridge. It does not publish real posts, send real
replies, or connect real platform APIs by default.

## Project Purpose

The goal is to build a safe local AI command center that helps a business turn its own photos, videos, brand context, and performance history into reviewed social media content.

The app is intended to help non-developer users:

- Define a business identity in a Brand Brain.
- Upload and organize job photos and videos.
- Generate platform-specific post drafts with AI.
- Review, edit, approve, reject, or revise drafts.
- Schedule approved drafts on a local content calendar.
- Prepare a publish queue for manual export first.
- Track analytics manually or with mock/demo data.
- Manage engagement locally with AI-assisted reply suggestions.
- Learn from approvals, rejections, engagement, and performance over time.

## Core Features

Planned core features:

- Brand Brain for business identity, voice, services, offers, claims, and audience context.
- Media Library for local photos, videos, thumbnails, and metadata.
- AI content generation using a mock provider first.
- Drafts and human approval workflow.
- Local-only calendar scheduling.
- Publish Queue for approved and scheduled content.
- Manual export packages for safe posting outside the app.
- Connected Accounts area for future mock and real integration setup.
- Analytics Dashboard for mock, manual, imported, and future platform data.
- Engagement Inbox with local AI reply suggestions.
- AI Memory for learning from user choices and performance.
- Safety Center with emergency pause and kill switch controls.
- Backup, export, and diagnostics tools.

Current completed feature level: local SQLite workflows through Batch 7
recovery, with real publishing and real reply sending intentionally disabled.

## Local-First Privacy Approach

This app is local-first by default. User data should live on the user's machine unless a future feature explicitly requires and documents an external service.

Local-first rules:

- Store app data locally by default.
- Store media files locally by default.
- Use SQLite for MVP data storage.
- Keep real platform integrations disabled until explicitly implemented later.
- Do not scrape social platforms.
- Do not commit local databases, real media, exports, logs, backups, tokens, or secrets.
- Keep mock/demo mode working before adding real providers.
- Keep manual export as the safe publishing path until real publishing is implemented behind strict safety gates.

## Current Tech Stack

The MVP deliberately uses a small dependency-free local stack:

- Frontend: static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in `apps/web`.
- Local API: Python standard-library localhost-only bridge in `apps/api`.
- Database services: Python and raw SQLite migrations in `scripts`.

Possible later direction from `AGENTS.md`:

- Frontend: Next.js or another web framework only if the static shell becomes too limiting.
- Desktop: Tauri preferred unless the project later chooses Electron.
- Backend/API: keep the current loopback bridge for MVP; adopt a larger framework only when needed.
- Database: SQLite for MVP.
- ORM: Prisma or Drizzle for TypeScript, or SQLAlchemy/SQLModel for Python.
- Media storage: local filesystem under `data/`.
- AI: mock provider by default, with OpenAI, Anthropic, and local providers planned later.
- Jobs: lightweight local job runner first.
- OAuth: server-side only when future integrations are added.
- Token storage: secure local storage/keychain/encryption when available; otherwise `placeholder_not_stored`.

## Setup Instructions

The web app is currently a static HTML/CSS/JavaScript app. No frontend framework or package manager has been installed yet.

For now:

1. Review `AGENTS.md` before making changes.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` when local server-side configuration is needed.
3. Do not add real secrets to committed files.
4. Follow the batch prompts in order.
5. Run `python -m apps.api.local_server --database data/app.sqlite --port 8000`.
6. Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000` for the SQLite-backed web shell.

The localhost server automatically loads a repo-root `.env` file when it
exists. Use `--env-file PATH` only when a different local file is needed.

Opening `apps/web/index.html` directly remains available as a browser-only demo
fallback. See `docs/local-api-bridge.md`.

Python services provide the local SQLite database, scheduling, preflight, job runner, and manual export behavior.

## Development Commands

No package manager commands exist yet because there is no `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `Makefile`, or equivalent tooling file.

Current direct commands:

```text

python -m scripts.db.seed_demo --database data/app.sqlite
python -m apps.api.local_server --database data/app.sqlite --port 8000

Planned command names may include:

```text
npm run dev

npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run test
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:seed
npm run jobs:once
npm run jobs:dev

```

These commands are examples only until the project tooling is created.

## Safety Rules

Non-negotiable safety rules:

- No real publishing yet.
- No real comment replies or DMs yet.
- No auto-replies.
- No scraping.
- No secrets committed.
- Mock/demo mode first.
- Human approval required before publishing or replying.
- Generated posts must default to review, not automatic approval.
- Scheduling must only allow approved and safe drafts.
- Emergency pause must block scheduling, queue readiness, mock publishing, future real publishing, future real replies, and unsafe automation.
- AI must not invent testimonials, customer names, pricing, availability, certifications, insurance, awards, guarantees, or fake social proof.
- Real platform APIs must come later behind explicit safety gates.

See `docs/safety-and-automation-policy.md` and `AGENTS.md` for the full policy.
