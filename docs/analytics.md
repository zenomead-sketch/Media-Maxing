# Analytics Foundation

The analytics foundation stores local performance history for approved content. It does not fetch real platform analytics yet.

The local service is implemented in `scripts/services/analytics.py`.

The static web shell includes an Analytics screen. When launched through the
localhost bridge, manual snapshots, mock snapshots, and insight status updates
persist to SQLite. Opening the HTML file directly uses a clearly labeled
temporary `localStorage` demo fallback. The Python service remains the SQLite
source of truth.

## Supported Sources

Every snapshot records its provenance:

- `manual`: entered by the user.
- `mock`: clearly fake demo data for development.
- `platform_api`: reserved for future guarded platform integrations.
- `imported_csv`: imported from a user-selected local file.
- `estimated`: explicitly labeled estimate.

Mock and manual metrics must never be presented as live platform analytics.

## Local Tables

- `analytics_snapshots`: point-in-time measurements for a post.
- `post_performance_metrics`: local aggregate totals and trend summaries.
- `analytics_imports`: safe audit records for manual, mock, CSV, or future API imports.
- `content_insights`: explainable observations with evidence and confidence.
- `ai_memory`: durable learning records with evidence and provenance.
- `weekly_reports`: local weekly summaries.

## Simple Rate Formulas

The MVP uses practical comparison formulas:

```text
engagementRate = (likes + comments + shares + saves) / max(reach or impressions or views, 1)
clickThroughRate = clicks / max(impressions or views or reach, 1)
leadRate = leads / max(clicks or impressions or views, 1)
performanceScore =
  engagementRate * 100 * 0.4
  + clickThroughRate * 100 * 0.2
  + leadRate * 100 * 0.3
  + min(saves, 10)
```

The performance score is capped at `100`. These formulas are intentionally simple. They are useful for local comparisons, but they are not universal platform definitions and should not be described as authoritative.

## Analytics Service

`AnalyticsService` supports:

- Creating and updating manual snapshots.
- Filtering snapshots by Brand Brain, platform, date range, and source.
- Generating deterministic fake demo metrics in development/demo mode or after an explicit request.
- Computing and storing per-post performance metrics.
- Computing dashboard totals and platform, content-angle, and content-goal breakdowns.
- Ranking top and underperforming posts.
- Creating simple rule-based content insights.
- Recording analytics import audits.

Snapshots are cumulative point-in-time measurements. When several snapshots exist for one post, summaries use the latest matching snapshot instead of adding every snapshot together. This avoids double-counting a post as its metrics grow over time.

Manual and mock snapshots with the same source, post links, and date are rejected or skipped. Mock generation never overwrites manual data.

## Mock Analytics

Mock generation is local-only and deterministic. It uses existing `published_posts` rows with `publish_mode = mock` or `manual_export`, plus completed local queue rows that do not yet have a matching published-post record.

Every generated row uses:

```text
source = mock
rawMetrics.demo = true
rawMetrics.realPlatformAnalytics = false
```

Mock generation is available by default only when app environment is `development`, `demo`, or `test`. A caller can explicitly request mock generation outside those modes for a deliberate demo workflow.

Run a local summary:

```text
python -m scripts.services.analytics --database data/app.sqlite
```

Generate clearly fake local demo metrics and summarize:

```text
python -m scripts.services.analytics --database data/app.sqlite --generate-mock
```

## AI Learning Safety

Learning records must include evidence and confidence. A low-confidence observation should remain a suggestion to test, not a business claim.

Confidence guidance:

- `low`: fewer than 5 relevant data points.
- `medium`: 5 to 20 relevant data points.
- `high`: more than 20 data points with a consistent pattern.

The app should not delete memory automatically. A user should be able to review, dismiss, archive, or supersede a learning record later.

`scripts/services/ai_memory.py` now promotes explainable insights and local review decisions into idempotent, evidence-backed memory. `scripts/services/weekly_reports.py` creates one deterministic local report per brand and week. See `docs/ai-learning-loop.md` and `docs/weekly-reports.md`.

## Demo Data

The seed script creates one clearly fake `mock` snapshot, one aggregate performance row, one mock import audit, one low-confidence content insight, one low-confidence AI memory record, and one `ai_mock` weekly report.

Initialize and seed a local database:

```text
python -m scripts.db.init_db --database data/app.sqlite
python -m scripts.db.seed_demo --database data/app.sqlite
```

## Not Built Yet

- CSV import parser.
- Browser-to-SQLite API bridge for the Analytics screen.
- AI-provider insight generation.
- Real platform analytics sync.

Real analytics APIs remain future work behind explicit integration safety gates.
