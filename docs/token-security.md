# Token Security

This project is local-first and mock/demo-first. Real OAuth token exchange readiness exists for Meta, but raw token storage is not enabled by default.

## Current Strategy

The current MVP storage mode is:

```text
TOKEN_STORAGE_MODE=placeholder_not_stored
```

That means the database can remember that a mock or future account exists, but it does not store real access tokens or refresh tokens. If a guarded real Meta token exchange is manually tested while placeholder mode is active, raw token storage is refused and only placeholder metadata is stored.

The token security service lives in `scripts/services/token_security.py`.

## Storage Modes

Supported storage modes are:

- `keychain`: planned OS keychain storage. Not implemented yet.
- `encrypted_file`: planned encrypted local file storage. Not implemented yet.
- `encrypted_database`: planned encrypted SQLite token blob storage. Not implemented yet.
- `placeholder_not_stored`: current default. Refuses raw token storage.
- `insecure_dev_only`: development-only raw storage for local Facebook testing.

`insecure_dev_only` is blocked unless both are true:

```text
APP_ENV=development
ALLOW_INSECURE_TOKEN_STORAGE=true
```

Do not use `insecure_dev_only` with client accounts, shared machines, production deployments, or real customer data. It exists so a single local operator can test guarded Facebook Page posting before OS keychain/encrypted storage is implemented.

`platform_tokens` rows may store token metadata such as:

- social account ID
- platform
- token type
- scope string
- token version
- expiry timestamps
- encryption status

For `placeholder_not_stored` and `missing`, token blob fields must stay null.

## Tables

Token-related tables are:

- `social_accounts`: safe account metadata only.
- `platform_tokens`: token metadata and future encrypted/keychain references.
- `oauth_states`: hashed OAuth state tracking.
- `connector_audit_logs`: redacted connector audit events.
- `connector_health_checks`: local connector readiness snapshots.

## What Must Never Be Stored In Plain Text

Do not store or log:

- access tokens
- refresh tokens
- authorization codes
- client secrets
- API keys
- bearer tokens
- raw OAuth state values
- raw OAuth provider responses that may contain credentials

## OAuth State

OAuth state values must be generated securely by a future OAuth service.

The database stores only:

- `state_hash`
- platform
- redirect URI
- requested scopes
- expiry time
- consumed time
- safe error text

Raw state values are never stored.

## Frontend Safety

Frontend-facing account data must use safe DTOs. Normal account queries should not include:

- `encrypted_access_token`
- `encrypted_refresh_token`
- access tokens
- refresh tokens
- authorization codes
- client secrets
- raw OAuth state values
- state hashes

The helper `list_safe_social_accounts` returns account metadata plus token storage status, not token values.

`TokenSecurityService.list_safe_social_account_dtos()` returns a smaller frontend-safe shape:

- `id`
- `platform`
- `displayName`
- `username`
- `accountType`
- `connectionStatus`
- `capabilities`
- `grantedScopes`
- `missingScopes`
- `requiresReauth`
- `lastConnectedAt`
- `lastValidatedAt`
- `tokenStorageStatus`

It does not include token values, encrypted token blobs, authorization codes, client secrets, full OAuth state values, or state hashes.

## Redaction

Use `redact_token_data` before writing connector metadata to logs, diagnostics, or audit records.

The redaction utility redacts:

- `access_token`
- `refresh_token`
- `client_secret`
- authorization codes
- bearer authorization values
- token-like long strings in known token fields

Redaction is a safety backstop, not permission to log raw provider responses.

## Expiration And Reauth

The token security service includes helpers for:

- checking whether a token expiry timestamp has passed
- deciding whether an account requires reauthorization

Accounts require reauth when:

- the account row already says reauth is required
- connection status is `expired`, `revoked`, `disconnected`, `error`, or `requires_reauth`
- the access token expiry is in the past
- the refresh token expiry is in the past

## Current Limitation

No keychain or encrypted local token vault exists yet. With the safe default `placeholder_not_stored`, guarded real OAuth token exchange can only create limited account metadata and placeholder token rows.

Limited Meta accounts created after a successful guarded token exchange should be treated as setup progress, not production-ready connections:

- publish-ready Page token storage is not available in placeholder mode
- long-lived token exchange is not implemented
- `requiresReauth` may remain true
- real publishing remains blocked

For Facebook only, explicit local development mode can store a user token and Page token in the local SQLite `platform_tokens` table with `encryption_status=insecure_dev_only`. That can create a connected Facebook Page account for the guarded Publish Queue path, but it is not production-safe.

Future secure storage work should add:

- keychain or encrypted local token storage
- redacted diagnostics
- token backup exclusion
- revoke/disconnect behavior
- tests proving tokens are never exposed to frontend DTOs

## Future OS Keychain Or Encryption Design

A future secure implementation should:

- keep token access server-side only
- store raw token material in OS keychain where available, or encrypted local storage with a key outside the database
- store only token references and safe metadata in SQLite
- exclude token material from backups and diagnostics by default
- redact provider responses before audit logging
- require explicit development-only opt-in before any insecure local token experiment
- keep frontend DTOs limited to safe account status and scope metadata

Real OAuth should remain off for non-Facebook platforms until secure storage is implemented and tested. For personal Facebook testing, use `insecure_dev_only` only after reading `docs/facebook-real-use.md`.

## How To Test

Run:

```text
python -m unittest tests.test_token_security_service tests.test_social_connection_models
```

These tests cover redaction, placeholder storage refusal, safe DTOs, database constraints, OAuth state hash storage, token metadata rows, and reauth helpers.
