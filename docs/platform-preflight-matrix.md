# Platform Preflight Matrix

The MVP preflight matrix lives in `scripts/services/preflight.py`.

It is intentionally local-only and uses practical placeholder limits. These values are not final production API limits. Real platform limits, scopes, media rules, aspect ratios, and account requirements must be verified against official platform API documentation when real integrations are implemented.

Requirement version:

```text
mvp-platform-requirements-v1
```

## Result Format

Preflight returns:

- `status`: `passed`, `warning`, or `failed`.
- `errors`: blocking issues.
- `warnings`: non-blocking issues.
- `info`: informational guidance.
- `checkedAt`: UTC timestamp.
- `platform`: platform ID.
- `requirementVersion`: matrix version used.
- `accountCheckStatus`: account readiness state, such as `missing_account`, `connected`, `limited`, or `requires_reauth`.
- `matchedSocialAccountId`: safe account ID when a matching account is found.
- `accountWarnings`: account issues that do not block manual export.
- `accountErrors`: account issues that block only future real publishing eligibility.
- `missingScopes`: scopes that may be required before future real publishing.
- `requiresReauth`: whether the matched account needs reconnect.
- `connectionStatus`: stored account connection status.
- `realPublishingEligible`: false for all platforms by default. It can become true only for the guarded Facebook Page text/single-image path when content passes preflight, the connected Page is ready, and explicit real Facebook flags are enabled.
- `manualExportEligible`: true when local content preflight has no blocking errors.
- `mockPublishEligible`: true only in mock mode when local content preflight has no blocking errors.

Errors block readiness. Warnings do not block readiness. Info is guidance only.

Account errors are scoped to future real publishing. They do not block manual export by themselves.

## Validation Checks

The preflight service checks:

- Draft approval status.
- Emergency pause.
- Supported platform.
- Caption/text presence.
- Caption/text length.
- Media requirement.
- Local media record existence.
- Supported media type.
- Video requirement.
- Critical safety flags.
- Brand profile existence.
- Queue item status.
- Title requirement.
- Unresolved revision request.
- Rejected or archived drafts.
- Scheduled time existence.
- Future account connection readiness.
- Missing account warning for manual export.
- Expired, revoked, or requires-reauth accounts.
- Missing account scopes for future real publishing.

## Account Readiness Rules

- Approved scheduled content can still be prepared without a connected account.
- Manual export is allowed without a connected account when all content checks pass.
- Mock publish can be eligible in mock mode without requiring a real connected account.
- Future real publishing requires a matching connected account, required scopes, and no reauth requirement.
- Broad real publishing remains disabled. Mock accounts never satisfy guarded Facebook Page publishing, even when the rest of the content passes preflight.
- Missing accounts, missing scopes, and reconnect needs are shown clearly so the user can prepare for later integrations.

## Current Limitations

- No real platform APIs are called.
- No scraping is performed.
- Connected account checks are local readiness checks only. They do not call provider APIs.
- Exact API limits are TODOs for future official-doc verification.
- Vertical video preference is not enforced until media metadata includes dimensions/aspect ratio.

## Updating The Matrix

When real integrations are added later:

1. Verify platform limits and media requirements against official platform API documentation.
2. Update `PLATFORM_REQUIREMENT_MATRIX` in `scripts/services/preflight.py`.
3. Change `REQUIREMENT_VERSION` when behavior changes.
4. Update this document with the verified source and date.
5. Add or update tests in `tests/test_preflight_service.py`.
6. Confirm `tests/test_local_job_runner.py` and `tests/test_batch4_full_workflow.py` still pass.

Do not use scraped platform data. Do not treat placeholder limits as production-ready API guarantees.
