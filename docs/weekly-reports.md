# Weekly Reports

Weekly reports are deterministic local summaries built from analytics snapshots. They help the owner review performance without requiring live platform analytics.

The service lives in `scripts/services/weekly_reports.py`.

## Report Contents

Each report stores:

- Brand Brain ID.
- Week start and end dates.
- Plain-language summary.
- Wins.
- Concerns.
- Recommendations.
- Top local posts.
- Underperforming local posts.
- Platform breakdown.
- Metric totals and source labels.
- Engagement summary and lead signals.
- Learning-memory updates.
- Next-week content suggestions.
- Evidence references and local-only generation metadata.
- Generator label: `system`, `ai_mock`, `ai_provider`, or `manual`.

The current generator uses only local deterministic logic. It does not call an
AI provider. `promptMetadata.generator = rule_based_local_v1`,
`promptMetadata.aiProviderCalled = false`, and
`promptMetadata.externalDataSent = false` make that boundary explicit.

## Provenance

Mock-only weeks use:

```text
generated_by = ai_mock
metricTotals.demo = true
metricTotals.sources = ["mock"]
```

Weeks with no snapshots get an honest empty summary. Manual and future imported data retain their source labels.

Engagement summaries use counts and local record IDs. Reports do not copy
private comment or message text into learning evidence.

## Idempotency

Each brand and week has one stable generated report ID. Regenerating a week updates that report instead of creating duplicates.

## Generate A Report

```text
python -m scripts.services.weekly_reports --database data/app.sqlite --brand-profile-id demo-brand-brightside-exterior-care --week-start-date 2026-06-08
```

Optional source filter:

```text
python -m scripts.services.weekly_reports --database data/app.sqlite --brand-profile-id demo-brand-brightside-exterior-care --week-start-date 2026-06-08 --source manual
```

## Review Reports In The App

Open Analytics and use **Weekly review and AI memory**. Choose a week start
date, then select **Generate weekly report**. When the localhost bridge is
running, the report is generated from SQLite-backed local analytics and
persists after refresh.

The same panel lets the owner refresh evidence-backed AI memory and dismiss or
archive a memory record without deleting it.

## Local-First Limits

- No real analytics APIs are called.
- Reports are only as reliable as their labeled local inputs.
- Mock reports are for demo and development only.
- Small samples remain clearly described as ideas to test, not guarantees.
