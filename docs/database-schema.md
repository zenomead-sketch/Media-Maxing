# Local-First Database Schema

This document describes the local SQLite schema for the MVP. The schema is implemented with SQL migrations in `scripts/db/migrations/`.

The database should live in the local app data directory, such as `data/app.sqlite` during development. JSON fields are acceptable for SQLite where they keep the MVP simpler, especially for arrays, metadata, safety evidence, prompt metadata, and mock provider data.

## General Principles

- SQLite is the MVP database.
- Data is local-first by default.
- Real platform publishing is not implemented.
- Real reply sending is not implemented.
- Raw access tokens, refresh tokens, API keys, authorization codes, and client secrets must not be stored in normal app tables.
- Mock/demo data must be clearly distinguishable from manual, imported, or future platform data.
- Deleting user data should require explicit confirmation in the app when implemented.

## users

### Purpose

Stores the local app user, owner, or operator profile. The MVP may only need one user, but keeping this table makes future multi-profile support easier.

### Important Fields

- `id`: primary key.
- `display_name`: user-facing name.
- `email`: optional local contact email.
- `created_at`: creation timestamp.
- `updated_at`: last update timestamp.

### Relationships

- One `users` row can own many `brand_profiles`.
- One `users` row can own one or more `app_settings` records, though the MVP should usually use one active settings record.

### Privacy/Security Notes

- Email is optional and should not be required for local use.
- Do not assume a cloud login exists.
- Do not store social platform credentials here.

## brand_profiles

### Purpose

Stores the Brand Brain: business identity, voice, services, audience, supported claims, offers, and content preferences.

### Important Fields

- `id`: primary key.
- `user_id`: owner reference.
- `business_name`: business name used in drafts.
- `description`: plain-language business description.
- `voice`: brand voice and writing style.
- `services_json`: services offered.
- `locations_json`: service areas or store locations.
- `target_audience`: intended customer types.
- `supported_claims_json`: claims the business has evidence for.
- `blocked_phrases_json`: words or claims AI should avoid.
- `preferences_json`: extra Brand Brain fields such as tagline, industry, tone rules, preferred words, common CTAs, hashtags, website, phone, email, approval rules, safety rules, and example posts.
- `created_at`: creation timestamp.
- `updated_at`: last update timestamp.

### Relationships

- Belongs to `users`.
- Referenced by `content_ideas`, `generated_posts`, and `ai_memory`.
- May be used by future reply suggestions and safety checks.

### Privacy/Security Notes

- Brand claims should be user-provided and supportable.
- AI must not invent testimonials, certifications, licensing, insurance, pricing, awards, guarantees, or availability.
- Private customer information should not be stored in brand-level fields.
- Brand profile contact fields are business contact fields only. Do not store API keys, OAuth tokens, or private customer data here.

Stores local weekly summaries for later reporting screens.

### Important Fields

- `id`: primary key.
- `brand_profile_id`: related Brand Brain.
- `week_start_date` and `week_end_date`: report range.
- `summary`: plain-language overview.
- `wins_json`, `concerns_json`, and `recommendations_json`: structured report sections.
- `top_posts_json`, `platform_breakdown_json`, and `metric_totals_json`: local summary data.
- `generated_by`: `system`, `ai_mock`, `ai_provider`, or `manual`.
- `created_at`: creation timestamp.
- `updated_at`: last update timestamp.

### Relationships

- Belongs to `brand_profiles`.
- May summarize `analytics_snapshots`, `post_performance_metrics`, and `content_insights`.

### Privacy/Security Notes

- Mock reports must use `generated_by = ai_mock`.
- Reports should distinguish fake demo metrics, manual metrics, and future API metrics.
- Reports are local summaries and should not include unnecessary private customer details.
- `scripts/services/weekly_reports.py` upserts one deterministic report per brand and week.

## approval_logs

### Purpose

Stores human review and approval history for drafts, scheduled posts, queue-like states, and future reply suggestions.

The approval queue service records structured action metadata in `changed_fields_json` for status transitions. Future scheduling and publishing gates should read draft state through `scripts/services/approval_queue.py` rather than inferring readiness from logs alone.

### Important Fields

- `id`: primary key.
- `entity_type`: reviewed entity type, such as `generated_post`, `scheduled_post`, or future `reply_suggestion`.
- `entity_id`: reviewed entity ID.
- `action`: `approved`, `rejected`, `revision_requested`, `archived`, `edited`, or similar action.
- `actor_label`: local display label for who acted.
- `notes`: optional review notes.
- `changed_fields_json`: edited fields or summarized changes.
- `created_at`: creation timestamp.

### Relationships

- Can reference `generated_posts` by entity fields.
- Can reference `scheduled_posts` by entity fields.
- May be used as evidence for `ai_memory`.

### Privacy/Security Notes

- Approval logs should preserve a local audit trail for safety decisions.
- Logs may contain sensitive review notes and should stay local.
- Do not use approval logs to bypass future approval requirements.
- Editing an approved draft should create `edited_requires_reapproval`, set the draft back to `needs_review`, and preserve the edited fields in `changed_fields_json`.

## ai_memory

### Purpose

Stores learning records from approvals, rejections, analytics, engagement, media metadata, and Brand Brain updates.

### Important Fields

- `id`: primary key.
- `brand_profile_id`: optional related Brand Brain.
- `memory_type`: `brand_rule`, `content_preference`, `audience_learning`, `platform_learning`, `performance_learning`, `safety_learning`, `user_preference`, `rejected_strategy`, or `approved_strategy`.
- `title`: short memory label.
- `content`: plain-language memory.
- `summary`: backward-compatible legacy summary retained for existing local records.
- `confidence`: `low`, `medium`, or `high`.
- `evidence_json`: supporting record IDs or summarized evidence.
- `source`: provenance label such as `mock`, `manual`, or a future learning-service source.
- `status`: `active`, `archived`, or `superseded`.
- `created_at`: creation timestamp.
- `updated_at`: last update timestamp.

### Relationships

- May belong to `brand_profiles`.
- May reference `generated_posts`, `approval_logs`, `analytics_snapshots`, `engagement_items`, and `media_assets` through evidence JSON.

### Privacy/Security Notes

- Do not delete memory automatically.
- Store evidence so the app can explain why it learned something.
- Be honest when data is weak.
- AI memory should not convert weak patterns into unsupported claims.
- Demo memory must be clearly labeled with `source = mock`.
- `scripts/services/ai_memory.py` stores evidence IDs and counts instead of private engagement text.

## app_settings

### Purpose

Stores local app settings, safety controls, automation defaults, and integration feature flags.

### Important Fields

- `id`: primary key.
- `user_id`: optional owner reference.
- `automation_level`: `manual_assist`, `approval_queue`, `semi_auto_scheduling`, `safe_auto_posting`, or `autonomous_content_engine`.
- `require_approval_before_publishing`: default `true`.
- `require_approval_before_replying`: default `true`.
- `emergency_pause_enabled`: default `false`.
- `kill_switch_enabled`: default `false`.
- `integrations_mode`: default `mock`.
- `enable_real_network_calls`: default `false`.
- `enable_real_oauth`: default `false`.
- `enable_real_publishing`: default `false`.
- `token_storage_mode`: default `placeholder_not_stored`.
- `settings_json`: extra local settings.
- `created_at`: creation timestamp.
- `updated_at`: last update timestamp.

### Relationships

- May belong to `users`.
- Read by scheduling, publishing, connector, AI, and engagement services.
- Used by future safety center and diagnostics.

### Privacy/Security Notes

- MVP defaults must require approval and keep real publishing disabled.
- Emergency pause must block scheduling, queue readiness, mock publishing, future real publishing, future real replies, and unsafe automation.
- Settings should not store secrets.
- Real integration flags should fail closed when missing or invalid.
